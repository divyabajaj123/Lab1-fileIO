# Lab1 - File Input and Output

Add your code in main.cpp file.

You are provided with a text file **input.txt** where the first line contains an integer. And the subsequent lines contain names.
Read the positive integer and store in some variable say *n*.

Next, read the first $n$ names from the file and store them in a file **output.txt**. You should consider the following cases:

* If integer is negative or 0, do not read any value. Instead write "No names copied" in the output file.
* If the number of names is greater than or equal to the integer, read only $n$ names.
* If number of names is less than the integer, read until the end of file.

Feel free to update **input.txt** file to try different cases.
